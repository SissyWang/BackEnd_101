#3
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

The reason is: 
ruby pass value as pass a refenrence into objects. While passing values using a method,
This method will create a new variable, and this variable will only be valable inside the method scope
when we use String operator +=, this operation is reassign and created a new variable inside the scope of the method
When we call it after the method finished, this variable is already forgotten
<< operator will change the original object, so when we call it, it will call the changed original object

#4
My string looks like this now: pumpkinrutabaga
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins"]

The reason is:
<< modified the original variable my_string, it add rutabaga after the original string refenrence: pumpkins
= can not modify the original array, so as soon as the new array show up, the old array inside the method is forgotten. 

#5
def color_valid(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end 

reason: 
ruby will automatically evaluates statement
